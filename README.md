I have made a few assumptions during the implementation phase which i have detailed below.

Assumptions:

1) Preserve the order of the sentence

In the example provided: "This is a statement, and so is this."

I made a assumption that the order was meant to be preserved and based on this assumption, i made decisions on the implementation to use a certain datastruture.

2) The task was more focused on words so i have ensured that i ignore/remove any non-word characters.

Please observe my test cases to see this.
